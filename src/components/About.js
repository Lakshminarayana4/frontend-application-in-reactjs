            <p>
            Dr.Rathaiah never compromises in providing the best facilities for his students and believes
            slightest negligence in providing student amenities will create false notions in the young minds
            about the Institution and its faculty and carelessness, lack of interest will creep in to their minds
            and even the best teaching methods under these circumstances won't help them. He has
            always held strong conviction that an Institution should faculty and carelessness, lack of
            interest will creep in to their minds and even the best teaching methods under these
            circumstances won't help them. He has always held strong conviction that an Institution should
            make every student perform well in his studies and live up to the expectation the parents
            reposed on the group. Such an institution should provide a conducive atmosphere where there
            is no pollution in any form for the students to study better and better. Accordingly all the
            Vignan institutions have been set up far from the madding crowds in a serene and calm
            environs

            For a person who hails from a small village, climbing all the peaks in his chosen path has
            brought many laurels, yet the MASTER as fondly called by his students is humble enough to
            admit that he has to reach many more peaks in his relentless crusade.
